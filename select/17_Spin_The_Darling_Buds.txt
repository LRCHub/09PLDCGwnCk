In your eyes i can see my reflection
Does that mean i'm getting too close
I'm moving to watch your direction
And my head starts to spin once again

You can spin with me
You can spin and you will see
Spin with me
Spin with me

In your face i can see that there's nothing
Does that mean you don't want to know
I feel kind of funny, i'm shaking
And my head starts to spin once again

Round and round and round you go
Round and round and round i just don't know

And you can spin with me
And you can spin with me
And you can spin with me
